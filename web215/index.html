<li><span class="li_header">Personal Background: </span>From Michigan with pit-stops in Cleveland and Pittsburgh before moving to Charlotte</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Professional Background: </span>My background is in banking/finance, but decided to change careers in 2021. I work in technical support for a large, hated telecom company</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Academic Background: </span> B.A and M.A. in Economics from Cleveland State University. Went back to school in 2015 as a college dropout and graduated in 2017 with a Master’s!</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Background in Subject: </span>I know the basics in HTML and JS, and can stumble through CSS</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Primary Computer Platform: </span>Macbook Air. Got it for CPCC so I could write file paths with forward slashes, to use/compile virtually any *nix source code, and not have to charge my laptop’s battery every two hours</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Courses I'm in & Why: </span>I work more than full-time, so this is my only course until March. I’m also studying for my CCNA. I got approval to sub Web-215 for the Enterprise Java class required for the Software Development degree, because half of Enterprise Java was learning to build GUI’s with JavaFx and Swing, and nobody builds GUI’s in anything other than web technologies anymore</li>

<li><span class="li_header">Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </span>I am on the CIA watch list. On a vacation in 2018,  I spent too much time loitering around  the CIA headquarters in Langley, VA. The local police stopped me and asked why I was there. I nervously replied, “because I wanted to see this place that’s in all of the spy movies, but I guess that was a bad idea?” Undoubtedly, local police gave my name to the CIA</li>

<li><span class="li_header">I’d also like to share:  </span>Nothing, this is the public Internet, remember?</li>
